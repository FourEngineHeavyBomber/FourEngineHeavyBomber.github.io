<p class='video-description'>Jack and David from Jack's coffee are folded in a deep family history with four generations working in coffee and tea, which gives them an edge not just with their suppliers all over the world, but also with how to properly prepare a cup of Joe. Jack's coffee's mission is to sell the freshest roasted coffee and let their customers enjoy these same bright delights as David did when he was a young packer. </p>
